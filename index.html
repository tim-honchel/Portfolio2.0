        <p>(headshot)</p>
        <p>Hey, I’m Tim. Thanks for stopping by! </p>
        <p>Creating great software is my passion. I want it to be intuitive for users, for the code to do exactly what it’s supposed to, be readable and maintainable for other developers, and tested meticulously.  I take pride in my work and invite you to check out my projects and connect with me through LinkedIn.</p>
